# Chess 2.0:

# optimize for speed so the A.I. algorithm can run as fast as possible:
# best way to represent the board: dictionary of strings for each piece
# dict input is a 16-bit number
# first 3 bits represent the piece:
# 001 - pawn
# 010 - rook
# 011 - knight
# 100 - bishop
# 101 - queen
# 110 - king

# next a bit for which color the piece is
# 0 for black
# 1 for white

# Next 6 bits will represent the piece location

# next include four more bits:
# pawns rooks and kings will utilize these bits for their respective
# special moves:

# For pawns:
# the next bit will represent whether or not the piece
# has been promoted
# 0 for no
# 1 for yes

# the next two bits for the pawn will represent 
# what piece it has been promoted to
# 01 for rook
# 10 for knight
# 11 for bishop
# 10 for queen

# the last bit for the pawn will represent whether or not it can 
# En Passant on the current move
# 0 for no
# 1 for yes
