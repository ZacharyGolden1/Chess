# Chess 2.0:

# board for the UI is a dict of lists
# board for the AI is a set of pieces

# optimize for speed so the A.I. algorithm can run as fast as possible:
# best way to represent the board: dictionary of strings for each piece
# dict input is a 16-bit number

# all pieces present on the board start with a 1

# first 3 bits represent the piece:
# 000 - pawn can advance 2 spaces
# 001 - pawn cannot advance 2 spaces
# 010 - rook
# 011 - knight
# 100 - bishop
# 101 - queen
# 110 - king

# next a bit for which color the piece is
# 0 for black
# 1 for white

# Next 6 bits will represent the piece location

# next include four more bits:
# pawns rooks and kings will utilize these bits 
# for their respective
# special moves:

# the next two bits for the pawn will represent 
# what piece it has been promoted to
# 000 for unpromoted 
# 001 for rook
# 010 for knight
# 011 for bishop
# 100 for queen

# the last bit for the pawn will represent 
# whether or not it can 
# En Passant on the current move
# 0 for no
# 1 for yes

# the last bit for the rook or king will represent 
# whether or not it can Castle
# 0 for no
# 1 for yes
